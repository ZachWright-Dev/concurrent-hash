Concurrent Hash Table
=====================

Overview
--------
This project implements a concurrent hash table that processes operations from
`commands.txt` using POSIX threads, a priority-aware scheduler, and a single
reader-writer lock to protect shared data. Each command executes in its own
thread, logs activity to `hash.log`, prints user feedback to `stdout`, and
writes query results to `output.txt`.

Building
--------
1. Ensure you have a POSIX-compliant environment with `gcc` and POSIX threads.
2. Run `make` in the project directory to build the `chash` executable.

Running
-------
1. Place your command script in a file named `commands.txt` in the project
   directory (a sample file is provided).
2. Execute `./chash`.
3. Review:
   - `stdout` for immediate feedback about each command.
   - `hash.log` for chronological execution and locking details.
   - `output.txt` for search results and database snapshots generated by print
     commands.

Command Format
--------------
Each line in `commands.txt` takes one of the following forms:

* `insert,<name>,<salary>,<priority>`
* `update,<name>,<salary>,<priority>`
* `delete,<name>,<priority>`
* `search,<name>,<priority>`
* `print,<priority>`

Priorities are integer values; lower numbers indicate higher priority. Command
names may include spaces but must not contain commas.

Logging
-------
The log file records, per thread (identified by priority), when commands are
issued, when threads queue for execution, when they are scheduled, and when
reader or writer locks are acquired or released. Timestamps are recorded in
milliseconds using `gettimeofday`.

Cleaning
--------
Run `make clean` to remove the executable and intermediate object files.
